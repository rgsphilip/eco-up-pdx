# eco-up-pdx

This is a project to help Portlanders reduce their environmental impact. I've decided to make it Portland-specific, since the resources available in Portland are different than those in other cities. As this project develops, people are welcome to fork it and make a project for their own cities. 

This project is in its very initial phase! Additional work + documentation coming soon.
