# eco-up-pdx

This is a project to help Portlanders reduce their environmental impact. I've decided to make it Portland-specific, since the resources available in Portland are different than those in other cities. As this project develops, people are welcome to fork it and make a project for their own cities. 

This project is written in Javascript using the React framework. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need `Node.js` and `npm`. You can download them at https://nodejs.org/en/download/. 

### Installing

After downloading this project, navigate into the eco-up-pdx directory and run:
```
npm install
```
This project is built on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), which provides a development, test, or deployment version of this app. From their readme:

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
